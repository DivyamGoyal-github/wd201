What are Node.js streams ??
Streams are a fundamental concept that powers Node.js applications.

They are a method of efficiently handling file reading/writing, network communications, or any other type of end-to-end information exchange. For example, when you ask the program to read a file, the file is read into memory from beginning to end and then processed.

Using streams, you read the files in small pieces, processing the content without having to keep it all in memory.

The Node.js stream module serves as the foundation for all streaming APIs.
